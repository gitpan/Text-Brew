	     <http://ling.ohio-state.edu/~cbrew/795M/string-distance.html>


PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I tested it only under Perl 5.6.

Text::Brew does not use any nonstandard modules.


INSTALLATION

You install Text::Brew by running these commands in the *nix environment:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)

To install Text::Brew in the Win32 environment, use nmake instead of make.
nmake is available for free (in a self extracting executable):

POD is readable with the command:
